        <p> <br>Happy Birthday! Here is a simple little website made just for you :) 
            I hope you can use it whenever you need a mental break. <br>Page updates TBD.

        <h2> <br><u>Welcome to the Magic 8 Ball!</u></h2>
        <p> <br><b/r>Background: </b><br>
            The origin of the Magic 8 Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized
            eight ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. The user asks a 
            yes or no question to the ball and then turn it over (or in this case click the button)
            to reveal an answer in the window of the ball.</p>
