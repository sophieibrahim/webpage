        <h1>~ Andy's Magic 8 Ball ~</h1>
        <p> <br>Happy Birthday! Here is a simple little website made 
        just for you :) <br> I hope you can use it whenever you need 
        a mental break and a laugh. Potential page updates TBD. 
        <b/r> (Send ideas if you have any)</b>
    </p>

        <h2> Welcome to the Magic 8 Ball!</h2>
        <p> <b/r>Background: </b><br>
            The origin of the Magic 8 Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized
            eight ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. The user asks a 
            yes-no question to tall ball, then turns it over (or in this case taps the button)
            to reveal an answer in the window of the ball.</p>
